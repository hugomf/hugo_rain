# Phase 6: Modular Drop Management

## Overview
The primary goal of this phase was to refactor the application to use a more modular and efficient approach for managing the falling character drops. The key change was moving from a single large slice of drops to a two-dimensional slice, where each column of the terminal has its own dedicated slice of drops. This change simplifies the animation logic and makes the code easier to manage.

## Summary of Modifications
Here are the specific changes implemented in this phase:

### 1. Shift to a Modular Data Structure
The `drops` field in the `MatrixEngine` struct was changed from a single-dimension slice (`[]Drop`) to a two-dimensional slice (`[][]Drop`). This allows us to group drops by their column, which is a more logical and scalable approach for the animation.

### 2. Updated Drop Initialization
The `createDrops` function was updated to reflect the new data structure. Instead of creating a flat slice, it now initializes a slice of drops for each column, with the number of drops per column determined by the `--density` flag.

### 3. Refined Animation Loop
The `generateFrame` function was modified to iterate over the new `[][]Drop` structure. The outer loop iterates through each column, and the inner loop updates and draws each drop within that specific column. This change directly ties the animation logic to the new modular structure.

### 4. Fix for the Screen-Filling Bug
To address the issue of the screen filling up with characters, the `NewFrame` function was updated. It now explicitly initializes every character in the Frame with a blank space (' ') before any drops are drawn. This ensures that when a character from a drop moves, the old position is correctly "erased" on the next render pass, preserving the raining effect.

### 5. Compiler Error Fix
A minor but critical change was made to the `generateFrame` function to fix a compilation error. The draw method for a Drop requires a pointer to a Frame, so the line `dropsInCol[i].draw(frame, ...)` was corrected to `dropsInCol[i].draw(&frame, ...)` to pass the memory address of the Frame object.

All these changes work together to improve the organization and functionality of the application, laying the groundwork for future enhancements.

## Data Structure Visualized with Mermaid
To better understand the shift in logic, here are two diagrams showing the state of the data structure before and after the changes.

### Before Phase 6: Single Drop Slice
The engine managed all drops in a single, flat slice.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[MatrixEngine] --> B[drops: []Drop];
    B --> C(Drop 1);
    B --> D(Drop 2);
    B --> E(Drop N);
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
```

### After Phase 6: Two-Dimensional Drop Slice
The engine now manages a slice of slices, where each inner slice represents a column and contains its own drops. This is a much more modular design.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[MatrixEngine] --> B[drops: [][]Drop];
    B --> C(Column 1);
    B --> D(Column 2);
    B --> E(Column N);
    C --> F(Drop 1);
    C --> G(Drop 2);
    D --> H(Drop 3);
    D --> I(Drop 4);
    E --> J(Drop N);
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
```
