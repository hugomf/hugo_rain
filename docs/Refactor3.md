Performance & Memory Optimization
Frame Re-use: In the previoius code, a new Frame object was created in every loop iteration, which is a major performance bottleneck. Version B addresses this by creating a single frameBuffer at startup within the Engine and reusing it. This is a common and effective optimization pattern in high-performance graphics and animation. By avoiding constant memory allocation and garbage collection, the animation can run much more smoothly, especially at higher FPS.

Pointer-based Data Flow: The Engine now returns a pointer (*Frame) to its internal frameBuffer. This means that instead of copying the entire frame's data on every call to NextFrame, only a small memory address is passed. This makes the data transfer extremely fast.

Robustness & Bug Fixes
Correct Delta Rendering: Your previous Screen.Draw method had a critical logic error. It would assign the incoming frame f to its s.prev field. When the main loop called engine.NextFrame(), it would update the very same memory location s.prev was pointing to. This made the comparison f.chars[row][col] != s.prev.chars[row][col] always false, causing the animation to "freeze" after the first frame. Version B fixes this by performing a deep copy of the current frame into the previousFrame field, ensuring the comparison is always between two distinct data states.

Race Condition Prevention: The Screen's state, specifically the previousFrame, is now correctly protected by a sync.Mutex. While your Screen.Draw method used a mutex, direct assignments to s.prev in the main function bypassed this protection. Version B centralizes all state changes within the Screen's methods, ensuring thread safety.

Code Modularity & Simplicity
Centralized Orchestration: The main function is now a clean orchestrator. It doesn't handle the internal logic of the animation or the screen; it simply orchestrates the flow. The Engine is responsible for updating the animation state, and the Screen is responsible for rendering that state.

Encapsulated Logic: The Engine and Screen components are more self-contained. For example, the Engine is now responsible for handling terminal resizing internally via its NextFrame method. This makes the main loop very simple and readable, similar to your original version.

Stateless NewScreen: The NewScreen function no longer requires terminal dimensions, as the Screen can get this information from the Frame it receives. This makes the Screen object more generic and reusable.
