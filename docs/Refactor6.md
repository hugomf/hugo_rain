## ✅ Improved Code Organization

- **Reorganized sections** in a logical order to reflect dependency flow and group related functionality:
  ```
  CONFIG → CONFIG DATA → CONFIG PARSER → TERMINAL → FRAME → DROP → DROP MANAGER → ENGINE → COLOR → SCREEN → MATRIX RAIN → HELPERS → MAIN
  ```
  - For example, `Drop` and `DropManager` are now grouped together.
  - Follows the natural execution and dependency chain of the program.

- **Renamed `UTILS` to `HELPERS`** to better reflect its purpose — contains utility functions like `clamp`, `max`, `min`.

- **Moved `Color` after `Engine`** since color logic is primarily used during rendering — aligning section order with actual usage.

## 🐞 Added Debugging Support

- Added a `Debug` boolean field to `Config`, enabled via the `--debug` flag in `ConfigParser.Parse`.

- Added debug logging in key areas:
  - `DropManager.Resize` — logs grid dimensions and total drop count.
  - `DropManager.Update` — logs drop activation and pausing events.
  - `Engine.NextFrame` — logs frame generation timing or status.

- Configured Go’s `log` package in `main()` with:
  ```go
  log.SetFlags(log.Lshortfile | log.Ltime)
  ```
  — Provides concise debug output with filename and timestamp for easier tracing.

## 🧩 Centralized Configuration Validation

- Moved **all validation logic** from `ConfigParser.Parse` and `NewEngine` into a new method:  
  ```go
  Config.validate()
  ```
  — Called once during `ConfigParser.Parse` for single-point validation.

- Defined **default configuration values** as constants:
  ```go
  const (
      defaultFPS     = 10
      defaultDensity = 0.7
      // ...
  )
  ```
  — Used consistently in `ConfigParser.Parse` for fallbacks and clarity.

- **Simplified `NewEngine`** by removing inline validation — now fully relies on pre-validated `Config`.

## 🔌 Enhanced Extensibility

- **Split drop management** into a new `DropManager` struct:
  - Responsible for creating, updating, storing, and resizing drops.
  - Reduces `Engine`’s responsibilities — now focused purely on frame generation and coordination.

- Kept `DropManager` and `Engine` within `main.go` to maintain the **single-file requirement**.

- Designed `MatrixRain.Run` to be **extensible**:
  - Isolates frame generation (`Engine.NextFrame`) and rendering (`Screen.Draw`).
  - Allows future hooks (e.g., post-processing effects, overlays, event triggers) without major refactoring.

## 📚 Improved Documentation

- Added a **package-level comment** at the top of the file:
  ```go
  // Package main implements a terminal-based Matrix rain animation with customizable
  // colors, character sets, density, and FPS. Supports debug logging and graceful shutdown.
  ```

- Added a **method-level comment** to `calcTrailColors`:
  ```go
  // calcTrailColors generates a gradient of trail colors. Steps must be > 0.
  ```

- Ensured **all public and key private methods** include clear, purpose-driven comments — avoiding redundancy while preserving clarity (as refined in Step 2).
