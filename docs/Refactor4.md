# Overview of Improvements to main.go

This document summarizes the improvements made to the `main.go` code to enhance **Separation of Concerns**, as part of a code review process. All changes are contained within a single `main.go` file, preserving the original functionality of the Matrix rain effect while improving modularity and clarity of responsibilities. Below are the key improvements, their purpose, and the benefits they provide.

## 1. Extracted Configuration Parsing into `ConfigParser` Struct

### Change
- Replaced the standalone `ParseFlags` and `resolveCharSet` functions with a `ConfigParser` struct containing methods: `Parse`, `listAndExit`, and `resolveCharSet`.
- The `Config` struct now only holds configuration data (BaseColor, FPS, Density, CharSet), while `ConfigParser` handles flag parsing and validation logic.

### Purpose
- Separate command-line interface (CLI) parsing and validation from configuration data storage.
- Encapsulate all configuration-related logic in a dedicated struct to clarify responsibilities.

### Benefits
- **Improved Modularity**: CLI logic is isolated, making it easier to modify or replace (e.g., for different input sources like config files).
- **Clearer Responsibility**: `Config` is a simple data container, while `ConfigParser` handles processing, reducing the risk of mixing concerns.
- **Easier Testing**: `ConfigParser` methods can be tested independently without relying on global flag state.

## 2. Encapsulated Configuration Data in `ConfigData` Struct

### Change
- Moved `colorThemes` and `matrixCharSets` maps into a `defaultConfigData` variable of type `ConfigData`, defined under a new `// ---------- CONFIG DATA ----------` section.
- Updated `ConfigParser` to reference `defaultConfigData.ColorThemes` and `defaultConfigData.CharSets` instead of global variables.

### Purpose
- Centralize configuration data (colors and character sets) in a single struct to improve organization.
- Make configuration data easier to manage, extend, or reuse independently of parsing logic.

### Benefits
- **Better Organization**: Grouping configuration data in `ConfigData` clarifies where to modify or extend colors and character sets.
- **Reusability**: The `ConfigData` struct could be reused in other projects or shared across multiple components.
- **Reduced Global Scope**: Eliminates global variables, reducing the risk of unintended modifications.

## 3. Decoupled Drop Logic into `DropController` Struct

### Change
- Extracted `Engine.updateDrop` and `Engine.drawDrop` methods into a `DropController` struct with `UpdateDrop` and `DrawDrop` methods.
- Updated `Engine` to include a `dropCtrl` field and delegate drop-related operations to `DropController`.

### Purpose
- Separate drop management (movement, activation, rendering) from the `Engine`'s core responsibilities (orchestration, resizing, frame generation).
- Allow independent modification of drop behavior without altering the `Engine`.

### Benefits
- **Clearer Responsibilities**: `Engine` focuses on high-level orchestration, while `DropController` handles drop-specific logic, improving clarity.
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Changes to drop behavior (e.g., new movement patterns) can be made in `DropController` without touching `Engine`.
- **Improved Testability**: `DropController` can be tested independently, mocking its dependencies (e.g., `rand.Rand`, `Frame`).

## 4. Introduced `Terminal` Interface for Terminal Operations

### Change
- Replaced the `TermSizeFunc` type and standalone `SetupTerminal`/`RestoreTerminal` functions with a `Terminal` interface, implemented by `StdTerminal`.
- The `Terminal` interface includes `Setup`, `Restore`, and `GetSize` methods.
- Updated `Engine` to use a `term` field of type `Terminal` instead of `sizeFn`.

### Purpose
- Encapsulate terminal operations (setup, restore, size retrieval) in a single interface to improve flexibility.
- Enable mocking or alternative implementations (e.g., for testing or non-terminal outputs).

### Benefits
- **Increased Flexibility**: The `Terminal` interface allows swapping implementations (e.g., a mock terminal for testing or a graphical output in the future).
- **Better Encapsulation**: All terminal-related logic is grouped under `StdTerminal`, clarifying its role.
- **Improved Testability**: The interface enables unit tests to mock terminal behavior, avoiding real system calls.

## Summary

These improvements enhance the **Separation of Concerns** in `main.go` by:
- Isolating CLI parsing in `ConfigParser`.
- Centralizing configuration data in `ConfigData`.
- Decoupling drop logic into `DropController`.
- Encapsulating terminal operations in a `Terminal` interface.

All changes maintain the original functionality of the Matrix rain effect (configurable color, FPS, density, and character set) while making the codebase more modular, maintainable, and testable. The single-file structure is preserved, ensuring all components remain in `main.go` as requested.
