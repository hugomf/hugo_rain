Summary of Changes
The refactoring process evolved in three main stages, each building upon the last to improve performance, modularity, and correctness. The changes can be categorized into three key areas:

Architectural Revisions: Shifting from a monolithic main function to a more component-based design with clear responsibilities for each type.

Performance and Memory Optimization: Drastically reducing garbage collection overhead by changing how frames are handled.

Bug Fixes and Robustness: Identifying and correcting critical logical errors and a race condition to ensure the program's stability.

Key Improvements by Component
main Function
Orchestration Logic: The main loop is now a central orchestrator. It handles external events like terminal resizing and time ticks, and then calls the appropriate methods on the Engine and Screen objects. This separates the animation logic from the display and event handling.

Single Frame Buffer: Instead of creating a new Frame on every loop iteration, main now initializes a single Frame buffer and passes a pointer to it to the Engine and Screen. This is the single biggest change for performance, as it eliminates constant memory allocation and deallocation, which is a major source of overhead in Go.

Engine
Decoupled Resizing: The Resize method is now a separate function from NextFrame. The main function checks for terminal size changes and calls engine.Resize() when needed, ensuring the Engine's state is updated correctly.

Simplified NextFrame: The NextFrame method no longer returns a new Frame value. It now takes a pointer to an existing Frame as an argument and fills it with the new animation data. This makes its responsibility clearer and enables the performance gains mentioned above.

Removal of Redundancy: The Engine no longer holds a context.Context field, as it's only needed by the main loop for signal handling.

Screen
Stateless Initialization: The NewScreen constructor no longer requires terminal dimensions (h and w). This is because the Screen's rendering methods now receive a Frame object that already contains this information, making the Screen component more reusable.

Internal State Management: The Screen now manages its previousFrame internally as a private field. This simplifies the main loop's logic, as it doesn't have to pass the previousFrame as an argument.

Correct Delta Rendering: The most crucial fix was to the deltaRender logic. The code was updated to perform a deep copy of the currentFrame into previousFrame after rendering. This ensures that the deltaRender function correctly compares the newly computed frame with a static snapshot of the previous one, fixing the "frozen" animation bug.

Overall
Correctness: A subtle but critical race condition in the original code's Screen struct was fixed by using a mutex lock to protect access to the previousFrame field.

Readability: The code now has better separation of concerns, clearer function signatures, and fewer dependencies between components. For example, the Frame and Engine are now largely independent of each other, communicating through the main function.

Maintainability: The modular design makes the code easier to test, debug, and modify. If you wanted to change the rendering method (e.g., to a different output format), you would only need to replace the Screen component.
