# Summary of Changes with Mermaid Diagrams

This document visually outlines the key changes and improvements implemented during the final two phases of the code review. These diagrams illustrate how the code's structure and logic were refined to be more robust and maintainable.

## Phase 3: Robustness & Security

The primary goal of this phase was to handle potential points of failure, ensuring the application is resilient to unexpected conditions like an invalid terminal size.

### Before

The application would attempt to render immediately after getting terminal dimensions, which could lead to a crash if the size was invalid.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[getTerminalSize] --> B[renderToTerminal];
    B --> C[Potential Crash];
```

### After

An explicit validation step was added. The application now checks the terminal size and exits gracefully if the dimensions are invalid, preventing a crash.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[getTerminalSize] --> B{IsSizeValid?};
    B -- Yes --> C[renderToTerminal];
    B -- No --> D[Exit Gracefully];
```

## Phase 4: Refining Main Function, Flags, and Configuration

This phase focused on centralizing configuration validation to make the code cleaner and more robust.

### Before
Validation for different flags was scattered across the main function after the flags were parsed.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[main];
    B[parseFlags];
    C[Validate Color];
    D[Validate FPS];
    E[Validate Density];
    A --> B;
    A --> C;
    A --> D;
    A --> E;
```

### After

All flag validation was consolidated into a single `parseFlags` function. The `main` function now receives a single, fully-validated `Config` struct or an error.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[main] --> B[parseFlags];
    subgraph parseFlags
        C[Validate ALL Flags];
    end
    B --> C;
    C -- Success --> D[Return Valid Config];
    C -- Failure --> E[Return Error];
```
